# Hi, I'm Steven Moody

Aspiring **SOC Analyst** and **Cloud Security Analyst** transitioning from the U.S. Army into cybersecurity.  
I focus on AWS security, SIEM/EDR investigations, cloud operations, and building a strong foundation in practical incident analysis.

My work centers around **structured reasoning**, clear documentation, and hands-on application — not just theory.

---

## Security & SOC Skills
- SIEM alert triage and log investigation  
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) analysis  
- IOC scoping, threat validation, Kill Chain mapping  
- Firewall rule design and troubleshooting (pfSense)  
- Understanding of malware behavior, C2 patterns, and metadata credential abuse  

---

## Cloud & AWS Skills
- IAM, least privilege, roles, and access boundaries  
- VPC design, routing, NAT, subnets, and segmentation  
- EC2 architecture, instance types, scaling, and metadata protection  
- S3 security (encryption, bucket policies, access points)  
- ECS, ECR, Kubernetes/EKS fundamentals  
- Strong cloud security mindset across all services  

---

## Current Focus
- Completing Adrian Cantrill’s AWS SAA curriculum  
- Advancing through the LetsDefend SOC Analyst Learning Path  
- Developing real incident-style investigations and cloud-focused artifacts  
- Strengthening cloud security and SOC triage workflows
